# Temperature Performance Metrics

Use the **Temperature Performance** component to quickly assess how your shipments are adhering to the required temperature range. These metrics also help you pinpoint where excursions might be occurring.

## Metrics & Descriptions

### Shipments with Temp. Data

Total shipments (within your chosen *Date Range* and *Product*) that have at least one temperature-reading device.

A small "Open in new tab" icon may appear, allowing you to navigate directly to a filtered view of those shipments.

### Shipping Temperature Ranges

Displays the designated temperature range (e.g., *2°C – 8°C*) for the *selected product*.

If no product is selected, you'll see a "Select a product" placeholder (since multiple products may have different ranges).

### Avg. Time out of Range per Shipment

Shows how long (on average) shipments spent outside the specified temperature range.

If the average time out of range increases from one period to another, it appears in red; if it stays the same or decreases, it's shown in gray or green accordingly.

### Shipment Count with Excursions

Total number of shipments that experienced at least one temperature excursion.

Clicking the arrow icon navigates you to a filtered shipments list showing only those with excursions.

### Avg. Excursion Temp. Above Range

The average temperature recorded for pings exceeding the product's upper limit.

Red if it has increased compared to the previous period; gray if unchanged or improved.

### Avg. Excursion Temp. Below Range

The average temperature for pings falling below the product's lower limit.

Red if it has *decreased* from the previous period (because a bigger negative number means a more severe drop), gray otherwise.

## When No Product is Selected

**Shipping Temperature Ranges**, **Avg. Excursion Temp. Above Range**, and **Avg. Excursion Temp. Below Range** are not displayed, as the system cannot determine the applicable temperature thresholds for multiple products.

## Comparison Badges & Tooltips

**Comparison Badge**: Next to each metric, a small badge (e.g., *+1*, *-3*) indicates how that metric changed relative to a previous time period. The badge's color reflects whether it's an unfavorable increase (red), a favorable decrease (green), or neutral (gray).

**Hover Tooltips**: Provide detailed info on which date ranges are being compared.

## Route & Segment/Waypoint-Level Changes

At **Route level**, these metrics are calculated only for shipments passing through that route.

At **Segment/Waypoint level**, results focus on shipments specifically traveling through that segment/waypoint.

# Shipments Temperature Profile Graph

The **Shipments Temperature Profile** graph visualizes each shipment's recorded temperature over time, enabling you to spot excursions at a glance. By default, this chart uses a *boxplot* approach to show median, quartiles, whiskers, and excursion points.

## Chart Elements

**Lower Limit & Upper Limit:** Two horizontal lines (blue for lower, red for upper) indicating the acceptable temperature range for the *selected product*.

## Detailed Shipment Information Panel

When you click on a shipment in the standard view (non-expanded):

**Shipment ID & Status:** Identifies the shipment and whether it had excursions.

**Start Date:** The date and time the shipment began (UTC).

**Number of Devices:** How many temperature-tracking devices are attached to this shipment.

**Recorded Temp. Range:** The min and max temperatures recorded across the entire journey.

**Number of Excursions:** Total count of out-of-range events.

**Upper/Lower Limit:** Your product's defined temperature boundary.

**Time Above/Below Limit:** How long the shipment spent above/below the thresholds, with a warning icon if >0.

**Average Excursion Temp. Above/Below Range:** The mean temperature of all pings above/below the threshold, including a warning icon if any excursion occurred.

**Review Shipment**: Takes you to a detailed shipment screen (the *Shipments* tab) pre-filtered for this ID.

## Route & Segment Views

At **Route level**, the chart and boxplots reflect shipments for that route.

At **Segment/Waypoint level**, it only includes the temperature data for the portion of travel through that segment/waypoint.

## Comparison Mode (Segments/Waypoints)

When comparing multiple segments or waypoints:

![Comparison Mode - Multiple Segments](/n32.png)

The chart label becomes **"Avg. Temperature Profile"** and each line represents the average temperature for a particular segment/waypoint. Hovering on the graph displays the temperature for each line at a specific date.

# Segment/Waypoint Comparison Table

This table allows you to compare performance metrics—like delays or excursions—across different segments or waypoints, even if they belong to different lanes or routes.

![Segment/Waypoint Comparison Table](/n34.png)

## Selecting Segments/Waypoints

**Select Checkbox:** Each row represents a segment/waypoint from a particular lane or route.

The first row (your current segment/waypoint) is always preselected; you can add up to four more rows for comparison.

## Table Columns

**Lane Name:** Displays the lane label along with a color-coded icon matching the route's color scheme in the UI.

**Route Name:** Shows the route path. Helpful for distinguishing multiple routes within the same lane.

**Shipment Count:** Total shipments passing through this segment/waypoint within your selected date range and product filter. A small badge to the right compares it to the previous time period (always displayed in gray).

**Number of Delayed Shipments:** How many shipments encountered delivery delays in this segment.

Comparison badge: **red** if increased, **green** if decreased, **gray** if unchanged.

**Avg. Delay:** The average time shipments are late (minutes/hours/days) beyond the expected transit.

Comparison badge: **red** if increased, **green** if decreased, **gray** if unchanged.

**# Excursion Shipments:** Number of shipments that went out of temperature range in this segment.

Comparison badge: **red** if increased, **green** if decreased, **gray** if unchanged.

**Avg. Time Out of Range:** The average duration shipments spent outside the temperature range. Comparison badge: **red** if increased, **green** if decreased, **gray** if unchanged.

## Sorting & Organization

**Default Sorting:** Rows are grouped by Lane Name in ascending order, then by Route Name (ASC).

**Checkbox Selections:** The currently viewed segment/waypoint is automatically selected. Additional rows can be checked to enable the multi-line comparison chart.

## Compare Mode Integration

If you select multiple segments or waypoints, the relevant performance charts (e.g., *Segment Transit Time Trend* or *Avg. Temperature Profile*) update to show lines for each selected row.

This table provides numerical detail, while the chart offers a visual timeline.
