# Introduction to Contxt

Contxt is a risk management platform powered by artificial intelligence (AI). It empowers supply chain leaders to proactively predict, prevent, and resolve risks in their distribution networks.

## What is Contxt?

Contxt evaluates shipping lanes to proactively identify and address vulnerabilities. In this way, organizations can better protect their shipments, reduce costs associated with delays or damage, and maintain higher levels of quality assurance.

## Key Concepts

In **Contxt**, a lane represents a specific transportation route used to ship products from an origin to a destination. Each lane is defined by a combination of the elements below. During initial setup, customers provide this information (and other system requirements) through the user onboarding process.

### Lane Components

* **Origin**: The starting point of a shipment, where products are first picked up or loaded.

* **Destination**: The endpoint where products are delivered, completing the journey.

* **Mode of Transportation**: The method(s) used to transport products, such as Air, Ocean, or Road. A single lane can include multiple modes.

* **Product**: The goods moving along a lane. Multiple product types can be associated with a single lane.

* **Waypoint**: Any stop or location along a route where goods are picked up, transferred, or delivered (e.g., distribution centers, transit hubs, or final delivery locations).

* **Segment**: The portion of a route between two consecutive waypoints, representing the actual path taken by shipments.

* **Route**: A complete path from the Origin to the Destination. This may include multiple waypoints, segments, and transportation modes. A lane can have more than one valid route.
