# Routes Tab

When you click on the **Routes** tab within a particular lane (e.g., *Lane: Frankfurt to Louisville*), you'll see a comprehensive interface for analyzing route performance.

![Routes tab header interface](/n52.png)

## Header Elements

The top section of the Routes tab contains several important elements:

- **Lane Name and Breadcrumb:** Shows your current location (*Lane Risk Assessment > Lane: Frankfurt to Louisville*)
- **Date Range & Product Filters:** Controls which shipments are included in all metrics
- **Navigation:** The **Back** button returns you to the Lane Risk Assessment page
- **Download CSV:** Exports route data based on your current filters

## Identified Routes

This section displays all routes identified for the selected lane, including those with zero shipments in the current filter.

### Route Information

Each route entry includes:

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Route Name** | Waypoints joined by hyphens (e.g., *Frankfurt–Port of Rotterdam–Port of Savannah–Louisville*) |
| **Performance** | Mono-color dots indicating performance level |
| **External Impact** | High/Medium/Low risk indicator for external events |

### Performance Indicators

Performance is represented by dots:
- **One Dot** = Needs Attention
- **Two Dots** = Average
- **Three Dots** = Optimal

> **Note:** Performance is calculated based on the selected date range. Routes with no shipments in that range may be hidden depending on filter settings.

### External Impact

This near real-time indicator shows possible disruptions:
- **High** (red)
- **Medium** (yellow)
- **Low** (green)

This value does **not** change with date or product filters.

### Default Sorting Logic

Routes are sorted by:
1. **Route Performance** (Ascending): *Needs Attention* → *Average* → *Optimal*
2. **External Impact** (Descending): *High* → *Medium* → *Low*
3. **Route Name** (Alphabetical)

### Pagination Controls

- **Items per Page:** Select 10, 20, 30, 40, or 50 items (default: 10)
- **Page Navigation:** Standard numbered page controls

## Route Metrics Panel

When you select a route, a metrics panel appears on the right side.

![Route metrics panel](/n55.png)

This panel displays key data for the selected date range and product:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Shipment Count** | Number of shipments within the filter parameters |
| **Expected Transit Time** | Contractual/agreed transit duration (e.g., *2d 12h*) |
| **Avg. Transit Time** | Actual average transit time for filtered shipments |
| **Delayed Shipment Count** | Shipments that missed the Expected Transit Time |
| **Shipment Count with Excursions** | Shipments with temperature or quality excursions |
| **Total CO₂ Emissions** | Carbon emissions for the route (units adapt automatically) |

A **Route Details** button takes you to the full Route Performance screen, maintaining your current filters.

## Athena Insights

![Athena insights panel](/n56.png)

Below the metrics panel, you'll see AI-driven insights labeled **"powered by ATHENA"** specific to the selected route:

- **Delivery Performance:** Highlights, causes, and recommended actions
- **Temperature Performance:** Excursion patterns and analysis
- **Device Performance:** Battery and connectivity issues
- **CO₂ Emissions:** Carbon footprint commentary

## Low Confidence Routes

![Low confidence routes section](/n57.png)

This section appears below the identified routes list when the system has flagged routes with:
- Insufficient data
- Less than 2.5% of total shipments for the lane

### Summary Cards

The header includes cards showing totals across all low-confidence routes:
- **On-time Delivery Performance**
- **Temperature Performance**
- **CO₂ Emissions**

> **Admin Feature:** The **Assign Shipments** button allows administrators to reassign shipments or update route definitions.

### Expandable Shipment List

Each low-confidence route can be expanded to show its shipments:

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Route Name** | Waypoints joined by hyphens |
| **Shipment Count** | Number of shipments matching current filters |
| **Number of Alerts** | Sum of delays and excursions (shown in red if >0) |

When expanded, you'll see:

- **Shipment Table** with columns for:
  - Shipment ID
  - Device ID
  - Start Time
  - Transit Time
  - Status (On-Time/Delayed)
  - Temperature data (Avg/Min/Max)
  - Number of Excursions

- **Pagination Controls:** 5, 10, 15, or 20 shipments per page (default: 5)
- **Expand/Collapse All** buttons at the top of the section

## Unresolved Shipments

![Unresolved shipments panel](/n59.png)

At the bottom of the Routes tab, you may see an **Unresolved Shipments** panel indicating:
- How many shipments are excluded from risk calculations
- Reasons for exclusion (missing temperature or location data)

A **Review Shipments** button allows users to inspect and correct shipment data as needed.
