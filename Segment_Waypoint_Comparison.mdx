When analyzing device performance at the **Segment/Waypoint** level, the **Comparison Table** helps you compare multiple segments either within the same route or across different routes and see how they differ in shipment counts, ping rates, battery usage, etc.

### Selecting Segments/Waypoints

Each row in the table represents one segment/waypoint from a particular lane/route. By default, the top row is your *currently viewed* segment/waypoint. You can add up to four more (for a total of 5).

### Columns in the Comparison Table

**Lane Name:** E.g., *Los Angeles to Chicago*, *Frankfurt to Louisville*. Includes a color-coded icon matching each lane's theme in other parts of *Contxt*.

**Route Name:** E.g., *Los Angeles–Port of Oakland–…*, *Frankfurt–Port of Rotterdam–…*.Distinguishes multiple routes within the same lane.

**Shipment Count:** How many shipments passed through this segment/waypoint. A small, always-gray badge might appear if it changed compared to a prior period.

**Avg. Ping Rate** (minutes): Shows the segment-level average ping rate for all shipments traveling that segment (within your date/product filters). A red or green badge indicates whether it has increased or decreased since the last period.

**Average % at Start:** The average battery percentage at the start of the segment. If it's gone up, the badge is green; if it's dropped, the badge is red.

**Average % at End:** The average battery percentage at the end of the segment. Badge color uses the same logic (green for improvement, red for decline).

**Average Duration:** The average transit/dwell time for shipments in that segment. If it's shorter than before, the badge is green; if longer, it's red.

## Performance Factor Tab Bar - CO2:

When you select **CO₂ Emissions** from the Performance Factor Tabs, *Contxt* displays the relevant analytics for carbon footprint. As with other tabs:

**CO₂ Emissions** appear with a numerical subtitle (e.g., *0.153 metric tons*) representing total emissions for the currently filtered shipments.

A **red triangle** warning icon displays if there is an alert associated with the CO₂ data (e.g., unusually high emissions), although it's less common to show a warning for CO₂ than for other risk factors.

## Segment/Waypoint Selector

When viewing **CO₂ Emissions** at the **Route** level, the Segment/Waypoint Selector appears as usual, but with CO2 specific metrics:

**Segment/Waypoint Name:** Example: *"Frankfurt to Port of Rotterdam.*

**Performance Data:**

**Shipment Count**: How many shipments used that segment within the chosen Date Range and Product. Shown in **blue** if it has changed from the previous period, or **gray** if no change is detected.

**CO₂ Emissions**: The total CO₂ emission for shipments along that segment. Displayed in metric tons (e.g., *23.345 mt*). **Red** if it has increased from the previous period, **green** if it has decreased, and **gray** if unchanged.

## CO₂ Chart:

![](/images/segment-waypoint-comparison/co2-chart.png)

This **CO₂ Chart** appears in the lower part of the screen when **CO₂ Emissions** is selected. It's a **bar chart + line chart** with dual Y-axes:

**Left Y-Axis: CO₂ Emissions (metric tons): Bars** show the total CO₂ for each time bucket (weekly, monthly, quarterly, or yearly), based on your date range and product filters.

**Right Y-Axis: Shipment Count: A line** indicates how many shipments contributed to emissions for each time bucket.

**X-Axis Bucketing:** Automatically scales based on the number of shipments and the selected date range. **Weekly** buckets if the date range is short. **Monthly** or **Quarterly** if the date range is larger.

### Route & Segment Behavior:

**Route Level**: Only the shipments on the selected route are shown.

**Segment/Waypoint Level**: Only shipments that used that segment or waypoint.

## CO₂ Segment Comparison Table

### Table Columns:

**Lane Name:** Uses a distinct color-coded icon matching that lane's theme in other UI elements. E.g., *Los Angeles to Chicago*, *Frankfurt to Louisville.*

**Route Name:** Clarifies exactly which route is being compared. E.g., *Los Angeles–Port of Oakland–…*, *Frankfurt–Port of Rotterdam.*

**Shipment Count:** Number of shipments traveling that segment for your chosen Date Range and Product. A small, always-gray badge might appear if compared to a previous time period, though its color remains gray even if there is a positive or negative delta from the previous time period.

**CO₂ Emissions:** Displayed in metric tons (e.g., *15.2 mt*). A red, green, or gray badge indicates if emissions went up, down, or stayed the same compared to the previous period.

**Avg. Duration:** The average dwell or transit time (in minutes) for shipments across that segment.

A red, green, or gray badge similarly indicates the direction of change.
