# External Impact View

When viewing the **External Impact** tab, the interface adapts to focus on external events rather than performance metrics.

## Header Information

The header area displays key information with the following modifications:

- **Date Range Filter**: Automatically set to *Last Data Refresh* and remains non-editable in External Events mode
- **Product Filter**: Shows "Select Product" but remains disabled as external events are not product-specific
- **External Impact Status**: Displays "No Events" when no relevant external events exist for the current selection

> **Note**: When switching back to *Lane Performance* or *Device Performance*, your previously selected date range and product filters are preserved.

## Segment/Waypoint Selector

When exploring external events at the **Route** level, the interactive timeline maintains its presence but with modified functionality:

| Element | Behavior in External Impact View |
|---------|----------------------------------|
| Metric Display | Shows only *External Event Impact* levels (High, Medium, Low, or No Events) |
| Selection | Clicking a segment/waypoint filters the map and event table to show only relevant external events |
| Comparison | "Compare to Other Routes" functionality is disabled in this view |
| Empty State | Segments with no associated events display "No Events" |

## Performance Factor Tab Bar

The tab navigation remains consistent with other views, with **External Impact** highlighted when active. 

If no external impact data is available, the tab will still be visible but will display "No Events" with a grayed-out indicator.
