# Lane Risk Assessment

The Lane Risk Assessment page serves as the central hub for monitoring and managing your shipping lanes' performance. This page appears by default when you log into **Contxt**, but you can access it anytime by clicking the Lane Risk Assessment icon in the left navigation menu.

## Lane List Header

![Lane List Filters](/n12.png)

The header section provides powerful filtering and search capabilities to help you focus on relevant lanes.

### Filters

- **Origin & Destination**
  - Multi-select filters allowing multiple selections simultaneously
  - Selecting a destination automatically filters origins to show only those connecting to your chosen destination (and vice versa)

- **Group & Company**
  - Refine results based on specific business groups or companies
  - Default selections follow your organization's **Contxt** configuration

- **Product**
  - Single-select filter that applies to all shipments in the lane
  - Default shows "Select Product" (no product selected)
  - Only displays lanes with shipments for the chosen product

### Search Bar

- Search across all displayed table columns and available lane metrics
- Terms like "air" or "ocean" can be used (note: "multimode" is not searchable)
- Quickly locate lanes by name or any associated key data

## Lane List

The main table displays all lanes matching your filter and search criteria, with each row providing key details:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Origin** | Starting location for the lane |
| **Destination** | Ending location for the lane |
| **Performance** | Visual indicator using dots: <br>• (1 dot) = *Needs Attention* <br>• (2 dots) = *Average* <br>• (3 dots) = *Optimal* |
| **External Impact** | Impact level of external events: <br>• *High* <br>• *Medium* <br>• *Low* |

### Sorting Logic

Lanes are sorted by default using:
1. **Primary Sorting** (Ascending): Lane Performance
   - *Needs Attention* → *Average* → *Optimal*
2. **Secondary Sorting** (Descending): External Impact
   - *High* → *Medium* → *Low*

### Pagination

- **Items per Page**: Select 10, 20, 30, 40, or 50 lanes per page (default: 10)
- **Page Navigation**: Use numbered controls at the bottom to move between pages

## Lane Metrics Panel

When you select a lane, a metrics panel appears on the right side displaying key summary data.

### Condensed View (Default)

- **Transport Mode**: Lists each mode used (e.g., *Air*, *Marine*, *Road*)
  - Shows "*Multimode*" tag when multiple modes are detected
- **Routes**: Number of routes (verified and unverified) in this lane
- **Shipment Count**: Total shipments processed in the most recent data refresh
- **Delayed Shipment Count**: Number of delayed shipments
- **Shipment Count with Excursions**: Shipments experiencing temperature excursions or other critical events

### Expanded View

Click **Show More** to access additional metrics:

- **Expected Transit Time**: Agreed-upon lead time for shipments in this lane
- **Average Transit Time**: 
  - Actual average transit time (e.g., "2d 15h [+3h]")
  - Color-coded: red for exceeding contracted time, gray otherwise
- **Total CO₂ Emissions**:
  - Automatically adjusts units based on quantity:
    - <1000 kg → metric tons (e.g., 0.314 metric tons)
    - ≥1000 kg and <1000 metric tons → metric tons (e.g., 78.731 metric tons)
    - ≥1000 metric tons → kilotons (e.g., 2.375 kt)
- **Lane ID**: Displayed if provided by the customer

Click **Show Less** to collapse the expanded view. **Contxt** remembers your preference when you return to the page.

### Lane Details

Click the **Lane Details** button next to the lane name to access a comprehensive view focused on performance trends, device and packaging details, external events, and more.

## Athena Insights

The lower-right corner of the metrics panel features an **"powered by ATHENA"** section providing AI-driven insights about each lane's status, organized into tabs:

| Tab | Focus Area |
|-----|------------|
| **Delivery Performance** | On-time delivery metrics, delayed shipments, average delay times, and trends |
| **Temperature Performance** | Temperature excursions and related impacts |
| **Route Performance** | Details for each route within the lane |
| **Device Performance** | Tracking device connectivity and battery life |
| **Package Performance** | Packaging compliance and improvement recommendations |
| **External Events** | Significant weather or geopolitical disruptions affecting shipments |

> **Note**: Disabled tabs will appear labeled but not clickable if they're unavailable in your current **Contxt** release.
