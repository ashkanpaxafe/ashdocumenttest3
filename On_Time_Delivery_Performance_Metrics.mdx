title: "On-Time Delivery Performance Metrics"
description: "Understand how well your shipments are meeting their expected delivery times and performance targets."
---

This component focuses on how well your shipments are meeting their delivery performance.

![On-Time Delivery Performance dashboard overview](/n17.png)

### Metrics Displayed:

**Shipments with Location Data:** The number of shipments (based on date range and product filters) that have valid location data and related updates.

Clicking the **Open in new tab** icon takes you to the Shipments tab, pre-filtered for only those shipments.

**Expected Transit Time:** The scheduled or contracted duration for the lane/route. A tooltip explains: "The expected duration of shipments."

**Average Transit Time:** The actual average duration shipments took during the selected timeframe. If multiple expected transit times exist, you'll see "Select a Route" to view exact data. A small badge indicates how much this average differs from the expected time (e.g., "+2h" in red if slower, or displayed in gray if faster or on schedule).

**Delayed Shipment Count:** Shows how many shipments missed their expected transit time.

**Color Coding:**

*Red* indicates an unfavorable increase (e.g., more delays or a longer average transit time).

*Gray* indicates a neutral or improved metric.

**Hover Tooltips:** Provide details on the current value, a comparison to a previous period, and any relevant notes about the timeframe. the comparison tooltip can provide details as shown for current vs previous time frame.

### Route & Segment metrics calculation Differences:

**Route-Level Calculations:** Metrics only reflect shipments traveling on that specific route.

**Segment/Waypoint-Level Calculations:** No specific *Expected Transit Time* for segments/waypoints, so those fields show "N/A" or a prompt to refer to the route data. Delays are shown specifically for shipments that had an issue in that segment/waypoint.

## User highlights:

By navigating through these components, you can gain a comprehensive view of how each lane, route, or individual segment is performing:

**Identify Your Focus**: Filter by date range, product, or navigate directly to the lane/route of interest.

**Review Headline Indicators**: Check performance factor tabs for any *Needs Attention* or *High* external impact warnings.

**Drill Down by Segments/Waypoints**: Understand where delays or excursions occur within your route.

**Check On-Time Delivery Metrics**: Determine how many shipments are delayed, how actual transit times compare to expected values, and whether device performance issues or external events might be contributing.

**Export Detailed Data**: Use the CSV download feature for deeper offline analysis or sharing with stakeholders.

## Shipments Transit Time Graph

The Shipments Transit Time graph provides a visual overview of how long shipments are taking to travel from their origin to destination and whether they meet, exceed, or fall below the *Expected Transit Time*. By hovering or clicking on data points, you can discover detailed information about each shipment.

![Shipments Transit Time graph showing on-time and delayed shipments](/n19.png)

### Graph Overview: A combined line-and-scatter chart showing:

**Trend** (solid line): Illustrates how transit times change over the selected period.

**Expected** (dashed line): The contracted lead time (if only one is defined for the lane or route).

**Delayed Shipments** (red dots): Shipments that took longer than expected.

**On-Time Shipments** (green dots): Shipments that met or beat the expected time.

**Average Transit Time** (horizontal dashed line): Reflects the average across all shipments within your *Date Range* and *Product* filters.

**X-Axis (Shipment Start Date)**

Displays the shipment's start date (UTC).

**Y-Axis (Transit Time):** Shows how long the shipment took from start to finish.

Units switch automatically based on overall duration

**Hours** if transit times are under one week.

**Days** if transit times are between one week and one year.

**Years** if transit times exceed one year.

### Filters & Display Options

A small **Filter** button (funnel icon) in the top-right corner of the graph allows you to toggle each of the five data sets on/off:

**Average Transit Time**

**On-Time Shipments**

**Delayed Shipments**

**Transit Time Trend**

**Expected Transit Time**

![Filter options for the Transit Time graph](/n20.png)

By checking or unchecking these boxes, you can simplify the view to focus on only the data that matters most to you. **Note**: If you have multiple Expected Transit Times for a lane, you'll see a note telling you to *"Select a Route"* rather than a single line for the expected time.

### Interacting with the Graph:

When you hover over any data point, a tooltip appears showing the Shipment ID and its Transit Time.

![Tooltip showing shipment details on hover](/n21.png)

For the *trend lines*, you'll see average or daily transit times based on your selected grouping (e.g., daily, weekly). Click to View Shipment Details: Clicking on a shipment data point (red or green dot) opens a Detailed Shipment Information panel on the same page if you're in Expanded Mode (see below).

![Detailed shipment information panel](/n22.png)

In the details panel, you can see:

**Shipment ID**

**Status** (e.g., *Delayed* or *On-Time*)

**Start Date**

**Transit Time**

**Expected Transit Time** (if applicable)

**Delayed By** (if the shipment is delayed, shown in red)

A **Review Shipment** button that navigates you to the *Shipments* tab (pre-filtered for this specific shipment).

**Expand Button** (two-arrow icon). Enlarges the chart to occupy more screen space, making it easier to analyze complex data.

### Special Scenarios:

**No Data Found:** If no shipments match your filters (e.g., date range, product), the chart area shows *"No data found. Try changing search criteria."* The chart lines and axes are hidden.

**Multiple Expected Transit Times:** If the lane has more than one contracted lead time (e.g., multiple routes in the lane have different expected durations), *Contxt* cannot display a single "Expected Transit Time" line. You'll see a message: *"Please refer to the Routes tab"*.

**Data Limit Exceeded:** If your selected range returns too many data points for the chart to handle, an error message appears: *"Data limit exceeded. Please select a smaller Date Range."*

**Single Shipment**If only one shipment meets your filters, the average and trend lines adapt accordingly. You'll typically see a single data point with minimal lines.

### Route vs. Segment/Waypoint Views:

**Route-Level:** The graph is filtered to include only shipments on the selected route. *Expected Transit Time* remains visible if that route has exactly one contracted lead time.

**Segment/Waypoint-Level:** Title changes to "Segment Transit Time" or "Waypoint Dwell Time".

There is no expected time for a segment or waypoint, so the *Expected Transit Time*line or filter option is hidden.

If comparing multiple segments, the chart becomes a Segment Transit Time Trend or Waypoint Dwell Time Trend, plotting separate lines for each segment/waypoint.

The hover tooltip shows each segment's or waypoint's time on that date.

![Segment Transit Time view](/n24.png)

![Waypoint Dwell Time view](/n25.png)

### Comparison Mode (Segments/Waypoints Only)

When using the **Compare Segment/Waypoint** feature (as covered in the *Segment/Waypoint Selector* section), this chart transforms into a multi-line comparison:

![Multi-segment comparison view](/n26.png)

Each selected segment or waypoint is assigned a different colored line.

Hovering over the chart displays all lines' data at that particular date.

The chart label changes to **"Segment Transit Time Trend"** or **"Waypoint Dwell Time Trend."**

![Tooltip showing multiple segment data points](/n27.png)

Clicking data points is disabled in comparison mode since multiple segments are displayed.

### Practical Tips

**Check Red vs. Green Dots:** *Red dots* indicate delayed shipments. review them first if you're troubleshooting time-sensitive products. *Green dots* reflect on-time shipments, confirming that everything is running smoothly.

**Use the Filter Button:** If you're only interested in delayed shipments, uncheck other datasets (e.g., "On-Time Shipments," "Expected Transit Time," etc.) to declutter the chart.

**Expand Mode for Deep Analysis:** If the chart is crowded, click **Expand** to see a larger view. This is especially helpful when comparing multiple lines or a longer date range.

**Navigate to Shipments:** For deeper investigation (e.g., device battery levels or temperature excursions), click on a point in normal (non-expanded) mode, then select **Review Shipment** in the details panel.
