This combined component offers both an **Interactive Map** and an **External Events Table** to help you visualize and filter external disruptions:

## Filters

Filter external events by route, waypoints/segments, event type, and severity:

- **Route Filter:** Multi-select dropdown for one or more routes. When you arrive from a specific route, that route is preselected.

- **Waypoints/Segments Filter:** Multi-select list that focuses the map and event list on disruptions at selected locations.

- **Event Type:** Multi-select categories like *Weather* and *Geopolitical*.

- **Event Severity:** Multi-select options for *High*, *Medium*, and *Low*.

> **Note**: The usual **Date Range** and **Product** filters are *disabled* in External Events mode. All external disruptions are linked to real-time or recent data.

## Map View & Interactions

The interactive map displays event locations with severity-coded icons:

- *Red* icons for *High* severity
- *Yellow* icons for *Medium* severity
- *Green* icons for *Low* severity

You can zoom, pan, and click on icons for details. Selecting map elements highlights corresponding rows in the table below.

## External Events Table

Below the map, a summary table groups events by type with severity counts:

| Event Type | High | Medium | Low |
|------------|------|--------|-----|
| Weather    | 3    | 5      | 12  |
| Geopolitical | 1  | 2      | 4   |

Clicking any cell (e.g., *Weather High*) filters to show only those specific events.

## External Events Feed

The feed displays individual event entries in descending order of severity.

### Event Row Details

Each row contains:

- **Severity:** *High* (red), *Medium* (yellow), or *Low* (green)
- **Event Type:** Icon and label (e.g., globe for *Geopolitical*, cloud for *Weather*)
- **Start Date & Time:** Event beginning (UTC)
- **Description:** Brief impact summary
- **Disruptions:** (For geopolitical events) Specific impacts like airport closures
- **Details Button:** Opens comprehensive event data

### Sorting & Pagination

Events are sorted by severity (high to low) then by date (newest first). Pagination controls let you navigate between pages and adjust items per page.

> If no events match your filters, a message reads *"No External Events Found."*

## Event Details

When viewing a specific event, a modal appears with comprehensive information.
