If you open a **Routes** tab and select a route, you may see a visual flow of its segments or waypoints. This interactive timeline lets you examine each hop from origin to destination.

## Back to Routes List

A button at the top-left corner returns you to the route overview for the current lane. Your date range and product filters remain intact.

## Route Title & Mode

The route name (e.g., "Route: Frankfurt-Port of Rotterdam-Port of Savannah-Port of Elizabeth-Louisville Ky") is displayed. You'll also see an icon or tag for the transport mode (Road, Air, Marine, or Multimode).

## Route Verification Status

A small icon (solid check, dotted circle, or X) indicates whether the route is *Verified*, *Pending Verification*, or *Unverified*. Hover over the icon to see a tooltip explaining its status.

## Segment/Waypoint Cards

Each segment or waypoint is displayed as a "card" showing basic metrics (e.g., average transit time, excursion count for segments, average dwell time for waypoints). Use the left/right arrow icons to scroll through the chain of segments from origin to destination.

**Selected Segment:** The currently highlighted card is your "selected segment." The lower section of the screen updates to show that segment's performance details.

## Compare Segment/Waypoint

A checkbox or toggle labeled *Compare* allows you to see how this segment/waypoint's metrics stack up against others. You can select multiple segments/waypoints (up to 5) across different lanes/routes for side-by-side analysis.
